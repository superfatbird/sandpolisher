# sandpolisher
A can of sand. A supporting structure. A motor. Several gears. A power supply. could make a good polisher for 3d printed parts

### 3D printing
A good practice is to print these parts in different batches. Printing of the larger gear requires very flat printing bed, print that first. The gcode generating algrithm intents to print the out boundry line first. It will leave a very thin bundry line spreads in a relatively large area. If this outboundry line pop up from any one tooth of the gear, the gear printing fails. That could ruin the batch. So do not put all the parts in one batch if you are not sure the printing bed is flat enough to get the large gear finished as expected.
